# Data Journalism

This is the repo for JOUR 472/772 (Data Journalism), a course taught at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism.

It is designed for use by students at the University of Maryland but anyone is free to work through the tutorials and exercises listed here.

## Course Syllabus

* **JOUR472/772 | Data Journalism**
* **Tuesday 11:30am - 1:50pm + Asynchronous Online labs**
* **1101 Knight Hall**
* **Sean Mussenden, data and computational journalism professor and data editor, Howard Center for Investigative Journalism**
* **smussend@umd.edu | 202-590-2190 (call or text) | @smussenden on Twitter | I'll do my best to respond within 24 hours.**
* **Office hours by appointment. Email me to set up.  My office is in the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism on the third floor of Knight Hall.**

### Objective

This is a practical, hands-on, skill-based course in the basics of data journalism. It is a journalism class that teaches students to use software tools, statistical analysis, data programming, computational thinking and other techniques. It teaches the transparent application of social science statistical methods to the analysis of structured and unstructured digital information as part of the investigative reporting process, a meticulous, community-based approach to unearthing key facts, patterns and proof in the service of telling stories.  

### Learning Outcomes

After successfully completing this course, we expect you to be able to:

* Use spreadsheets and data programming languages to “interview” data stored in structured and unstructured digital formats. You will learn a systematic approach to finding patterns, promising leads and stories in data and to discover what no one has ever known before, documenting your work in a way that is reproducible and transparent.

* Understand how to obtain and responsibly vet data: from government agencies through public information act requests; through online and offline databases; to access information through APIs; and basic web scraping.  

* Think about the limitations of a particular data set, work around those limitations and develop an understanding of what your data can and cannot show by using documentation and other sources. You will also learn to clean and prepare data for analysis.

* Understand how you might use the results of your data analysis as the foundation of or supplement to additional material in a news story and what additional work you'll need to do prior to publication.

* Understand how, despite advances in technology, the fundamentals of basic reporting still apply in data journalism. These include a devotion to accuracy, clarity, fairness, solid news value and, ultimately, good storytelling.

### Prerequisites

* **Graduate students in journalism:** Successful completion or current enrollment in JOUR 501, or equivalent professional experience.
* **Graduate students in other programs and special students:** Written permission or professional reporting experience.
* **Undergraduates:** Written permission of the professor.

### Required Texts, Materials and Software

**Textbook**

There is no book to buy for this class.

Readings from selected sources will be posted to ELMS or linked to online.

**Accounts**

You will need the following free accounts:

* [GitHub](https://education.github.com/pack) - lots of free benefits for students.
* [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) - y'all should have this, I guess.
* [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) - create a free account; do not pay for anything. I'll get you access for free for what you'll need.
* [Carto](https://carto.com/) - sign up for GitHub student pack first, then sign up for Carto with your GitHub account.

**Software and Languages**

All of the software you need to complete this course is available on computers in the labs at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism.

If you wish to work on your personal computer, you will find it useful to download the following programs.

* [The R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)
* [RStudio integrated development environment](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

The tutorials were written using these specific software programs, so if you use a different version of the program, or a different program, or a different operating system, your milage may vary.  

*Note: I am much better at debugging problems with Macs than I am with PC. I haven't been a PC user since 2009. I encourage you to use Macs for this class, if possible.*

### Grading

* Participation - 5%

### Attendance and assignment deadlines

Because much of the learning in this course will be hands-on, it is important that you attend *every* class and show up on time. Showing up on time means you should be in your seat, your mobile device put away, logged in to a campus computer (or your own if you prefer) and ready to begin participating *before* class starts. Missing class or arriving late will affect your participation grade. It is also important to complete all of the online labs on time.

Unless I note otherwise, in-class labs are due at the end of class. You must be physically present in class to complete in-class lab assignments. If you are seriously ill and will miss class, let me know before class, by email or text. Unless you have my approval in advance, lab work cannot be made up. At my discretion, I may request a doctor's note before granting approval.

This is journalism. Deadlines matter. Late assignments -- even one minute late -- will not be graded and given a zero. This includes major assignments.  Please take care to turn things in on time. Exceptions can be made on case-by-case basis in cases of serious illness or genuine emergency.  You are much more likely to get an exception if you notify me in advance of the deadline that you will not meet it.

Unless I note otherwise, weather-based closures of the university do not change assignment deadlines.   

### Religious holidays

There will be no tests or major assignments scheduled on religious holidays identified by the university. If you expect to miss a class due to a religious holiday, please notify the instructor in writing before the start of the second class.

### Academic integrity

Along with certain rights, students have the responsibility to behave honorably in an academic environment. Academic dishonesty, including cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty and plagiarism, will not be tolerated. Adhering to a high ethical standard is of special importance in journalism, where reliability and credibility are the cornerstones of the field. Therefore, the college has adopted a “zero tolerance” policy on academic dishonesty. Any abridgment of academic integrity standards in a College of Journalism course will be referred to the university’s Student Honor Council and the college's deans. To insure this is understood, all students are asked to sign an academic integrity pledge at the beginning of the semester that will cover all assignments in this course. Students found to have violated the university's honor code may face sanctions, including a grade of XF for the course.

### Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities requiring special accommodation during the semester should make an appointment to meet with the instructor as soon as possible.

### Course evaluations

The university administration asks students to complete course evaluations through the CourseEvalUM website at http://www.courseevalum.umd.edu/. This system is anonymous and will be open for your input toward the end of the semester. The evaluations are a useful element in curriculum development.

### Students in Need of Assistance

The University of Maryland offers a variety of services for students in need of either educational or psychological assistance. Learning Assistance Service (LAS) offers services and programs on writing skills, English as a second language, study and time management skills, math learning skills, and issues for students over 25 years of age. The service also offers a range of handouts, available online. If you need other educational services or support, please contact your instructor for additional resources.

If you are experiencing personal stress that is interfering with your ability to succeed, please consider contacting the Counseling Center or the Mental Health Service at the University Health Center for an appointment. The Counseling Center also offers online resources on a series of topics.

*Forum Posts | Due by Sunday at 11:59 p.m.*
**Links to ELMS pages coming soon**
* [Forum Post 1](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1268776/discussion_topics/3706521?module_item_id=9690994): We will spend much of the semester working with a newly-released database of opioid shipments, made available by the Washington Post. The Washington Post has been breaking stories of national importance holding the government, drug companies, pharmacies and others to account for their role in the deadly opioid epidemic that killed nearly 100,000 people in the U.S. between 2006 and 2012. Carefully read the story "76 billion opioid pills: Newly released federal data unmasks the epidemic" and listen to the interview with one of the reporters on the story, Scott Higham.  In a forum post of 300 words or less, do the following:
  * Based on the information in the story, briefly explain the nature of the database analyzed by the Post.  What is it called? What information does it include?
  * Identify two sentences in the story -- facts -- that you think were the product of original data analysis by the Post.
  * Google the people named in the story bylines and contribution line at the bottom of the story? What are the names and job titles of people you think worked on the analysis in the story?    
* [Forum Post 2](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1268776/discussion_topics/3706530?module_item_id=9690993): Skim through "The Data Stories Brainstorming" guide and "Data Stories: Census examples" from NYT Training include common types of "data stories" -- i.e. (contrasting two things, drilling down, outliers).  On your own, go out and find a news story that includes a bit of data analysis that fits into one of these "data story" frames.  It can be from any source. In less than 100 words, provide a link and explain how the story fits into that frame.
* [Forum Post 3](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1268776/discussion_topics/3706531?module_item_id=9690996): The boundaries of what qualifies as "data journalism" are not easily defined. Read "Why Journalists Should Use Data" and "Why Data Journalism is Important".  In 200 words or less, write your own preferred definition, why you are interested in learning to do it, and how you hope to incorporate it in the journalism work you do going forward.
* [Forum Post 4](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1268776/discussion_topics/3706532?module_item_id=9690995): We'll talk a lot about the process of data journalism in this course, the work data journalists do that ends with the release of a story founded on original data analysis.  Read "What the Fox Knows", "The Inverted Pyramid of Data Journalism" and "About the Markup."  Each of these offers some insight into the process of doing data journalism work, from the very detailed -- Nate Silver's breakdown -- to the less detailed -- Paul Bradshaw's take -- to the very short: "Our journalism is guided by the scientific method; we develop hypotheses and collect data to test those hypotheses," from the Markup. In 200 words or less, do your best at describing the process by which data journalists go from nothing to story.

* [Forum Post 3: Getting hidden data](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1268776/discussion_topics/3717151). There's lots of data available on the web.  But the truly good stuff, the data that will help you tell stories no one else has told, is only available with a fight. In 150 words, summarize how the Washington Post helped bring the ARCOS data to light. Then read the "38 excuses" post from Poynter, common responses from government officials for people seeking public records. I guarantee someone will tell you one of these things as you seek data for the data acquisition project.
