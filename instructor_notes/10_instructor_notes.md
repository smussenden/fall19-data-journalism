## No lab or other homework this week.
* I want you to focus on your analysis project and making it really good.

## Analysis Project
* Due this Sunday.
* Forum post update on exploratory analysis and draft markdown file.
  * In less than 300 words, describe what you've done so far, what you've found so far, and where you plan to go next. You should pull this from your Markdown file. Is there something you're having problems with, either conceptually or technically? Post it here.
  * Also provide a link to your class GitHub repo, where you've created a well commented R Markdown file that shows your initial attempts at loading, cleaning, understanding and analyzing the data. It should contain at least 15 specific questions, answers and code to produce the answers those questions.  Make sure the repo is public.
* This isn't the end of the project. You're just getting started.  Your initial analysis should point you where to go next.  What new questions can you ask?  It's okay -- even expected -- for your idea to pivot.  You may discover something new that could change nature of your project. Be OPEN to that.
* If I didn't talk to you last time, need to talk this time.
  * Meghan
  * Sara
  * Still need to create data set for Jazmin, total by month and year
  * Mia - good.  Ask big question: how are large cities different than small cities. Q: if looking at race, 60 percent of all african americans live in suburbs.  Maybe ask that q

## Data.  
* Many of you need opioid death rates.  I spent a lot of time working through this, and it's really only available at the county level.  ZIP Code is too small, and for privacy reasons it's frequently supressed from CDC output.  That may change nature of what you do, if you're relying on this data.
* In data analysis project folder.
* At least one of you is looking for heroin deaths specificially.  Not really available at that level either, only aggregated opioids.

## In Class
* We're doing the lab on working with geographic data and making maps.
* It's a hybrid. Some step by step, but also some figure out on your own.  I'll be here if you need it.
