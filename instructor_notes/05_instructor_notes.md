#### Questions ABOUT Lab
* How did we do?  Anyone run into issues that could be helpful to review?
* Questions about the lab you did two weeks ago? Anything people didn't understand? I'll be walking around and you can ask.  
* This week's lab will be posted by end of day tomorrow.  For real.

#### Discussion: why do we use these script files?
* We could use spreadsheets.
* We could just write r code in the console.  

ASK: Why do we do this?
* Allows us to keep track of our work.  If we make an error at any step, we just go back and fix and run it all again? Lets us come back years later.
* Allows our colleagues to feel confident in our work, including our editors who may not be data saavy and our colleagues who may not be data saavy.  True when we explain step by step.
* Allows our work to be easily fact-checked and reproduced by others with data knowledge.
* Makes others feel confident in our methods, including the general public and experts. We can send our files to experts for review.  
* Teaching!!!! THis is the my favorite reason.  We don't learn in a vacuum.  

#### Data acquisition

**Talk to one-on-one**

* Dana: switch assignments.
