# In Class Assignment 2

## Purpose

Today's in-class assignment is designed to reinforce the techniques you learned in the second lab, and give you more experience in doing journalistic data analysis working with opioid data.

## Setup

1.  Download raw data for Mingo County, West Virginia from the [Washington Post "Digging into the DEA's pain pill database" page](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/).  If you're having trouble, the data is available [in this folder](data/).

2.  Create a new Google Sheets workbook and name it "In_Class_Assignment_02 YOUR NAME Sheet".  Set the permissions to "anyone with link can edit".  

3.  Upload the tab-delimited text file into a new sheet inside of the workbook you created.  Rename the sheet with "logan-working". Don't worry about making a copy of the sheet to preserve the original.  It's too massive, and will crash Google Sheets.  You have the original text file if you need to start over. Create a new spreadsheet called "Source" that describes the source, date and details of the data.

4.  Set up each working sheet as you learned in the first video. This sheet is too big to do a traditional four-corners check looking for strange or missing values.  But you can get do a version of this check by turning on filters and examining the values in each column.  Add a "record number" column to give each row a unique record number.  Freeze the first row. Format the numbers nicely.

Reporter = Distributor
Buyer = pharmacy or practitioner
Labeler = manufacturer
What does transaction code S mean?
Build a pivot table to determine what the drug code numbers means
What does the NDC code mean?

5.  Create a Google Doc called "In_Class_Assignment_01 YOUR NAME memo". Set the permissions to "anyone with the link can edit". Paste the questions below into this memo document. Also paste a link to your spreadsheet.

## Questions

Answer the following questions.  You will need to create some new columns in the spreadsheet to do this and some new rows.  You will probably need to sort.  Be sure to keep your spreadsheet nice and tidy as you go. If you're confused what this means, look back at the example spreadsheet in our first lab video.      

1.  What was the name of the pharmacy that received the most total pills of hydrocodone and oxycodone in Mingo County, West Virginia between 2006 and 2012?

2. Pills are sent from a manufacturer ("labeler") to a distributor ("reporter") to a pharmacy, retailer or related business ("buyer").  In Mingo County, West Virginia between 2006 and 2012, which combo of those three (manufacturer > reporter > pharmacy) was responsible for the largest number of pills? Name the three entities and show how many pills?

3. What is the drug code for hydrocodone? What is the drug code for oxycodone? What percentage of all pills sent to Mingo County, West Virginia were hydrocodone and what percentage were Oxycodone?

4. How many different "transaction codes" are there?  What does "S" stand for?  Review the documentation to find out.  

5. Which state sent the most pills to Mingo County, West Virginia?  Use the distributor state to calculate this?

6. On what day did the single largest transaction (total number of pills) take place?  Describe the transaction in as much detail as the data will allow.  Do not need to do a pivot table to do this.

7. What is the NDC_NO field? Find the documentation.

8. - 11.  Develop four questions that you think might yield newsworthy information on your own to ask and answer.  Talk with your neighbors.
