### Openers
1. Make sure everyone is here for JOUR472/772, Introduction to Data Journalism.

2. Introduce myself.
* Data editor for the Howard Center for Investigative reporting.
* Before that I was data editor for Capital News Service and director of the college park bureau for about 10 years.
* I graduated from here 20 years ago!
* I've been a journalist for two decades, working as a Washington correspondent, a statehouse reporter in Florida.  For my whole career -- after taking this class here in 1999 -- I've made using data an important part of the work I do.  
* My teaching style is very hands-on, prioritizing learning-by-doing.  There won't be a lot of lectures in this course. There will be a lot of hands on work, because this work benefits from repetition.
* This is my promise to you: if you are struggling with the work we do in here, and you ask me for help, I will make time to help you. My office hours are Mondays and Thursdays or by important.      

3. Student Introductions.
* Have then fill out forms.
* Why are you interested in learning more about data journalism? (fine if you say this is required)
* How do you think this course will help you in your career -- and what do you want to do when you graduate?   

### Lecture/Discussion Content

* What is data journalism exercise?

* My definition of data journalism.
  * I come down more on the "science"-based approach, data science.
  * Shared by people like Phil Meyer, the godfather of this work, Julia Angwin at the Markup, Ben Welsh.  

* Transparency.  We are open about how we did our work and we freely share it and document it.  People don't trust journalists, and you can't just drop a story based on data analysis without backing it up. I'll show you my method for documenting as we do analysis.
* Analysis.  Sometimes this means computing fancy statistics, and using advanced machine learning.  But sometimes it literally means finding one tiny bit of information scanning through a spreadsheet, and using that as a foundation for further reporting.
* Digital Information. There is so much data in the world.  Stored in many formats.  Some of its structured, in spreadsheets. Some of its big huge bodies of dumped documents.  
* Reporting: It's not a separate thing from the reporting process.  It's part of the process. If you want to learn this because you never want to interview a human again, I have bad news for you.  Context.  Methods. Checks.  We'll talk again and again about that in this class.
* Meticulous. We always assume we are getting something wrong, and set out to prove ourself wrong. This means getting obsessive about how we look at data.  
* Community.  The growing group of people who do this work help each other, share data, share information.  NICAR and IRE. We'll get connected to some of these groups as part of this class.
* Facts, Patterns, and Proof: data journalism is great for both establishing a pattern that forms bones of a story -- a pattern showing opioid deaths increased in counties the most where drug companies sent the most pills -- and identifying anecdotes -- the pharmacy in the county in West Virginia with the highest death rate that received the most pills.  
* Stories: Our goal is to tell stories, not to present a bunch of data and say "look at this data".  That can happen in lots of forms, including text, graphics, video, podcasts, social platforms. We'll talk a lot about this.

### Syllabus Review

Hand out the syllabus and point out the highlights.

**Contacting Me**
I am here to help you.  I will do my best to respond within 24 hours.  You can text, just say your name.  You can email.  

It is especially important that anyone who falls into one of the following two categories come see me very early in the semester:
•	If you are finding this too difficult
•	If you are finding it too easy and the classes are a drag for you – we will have to brainstorm a solution, or I might ask you to serve during class sessions as a desk-mate / coach / helper to someone else in class who is struggling.

**Learning Outcomes**

The idea here is to teach you the pipeline from initial reporting, data discovery, acquisition, cleaning and verification, analysis, follow-up reporting, fact-checking.  To understand how to use data to tell stories. And as a foundation for future work.

Go over specific outcomes.

**Required Texts and Materials**

**Grading and attendance**

**Review Assignments** through **Students in Need**

-- Go over that.

### How Class Will Work

* Blended, half online, half in person
* Every week we'll have an Asynchronous online lab, meaning completed it whenever you want before Sunday. It will be released after class each Tuesday.
  * Designed to teach you skills and concepts critical to this class.
  * You'll typically have a file to upload after that.
* Every week we'll have a class on Tuesdays.  
  * some kind of discussion/lecture
  * an in-class data exercise designed to reinforce what you've learned in prior week's lab.
  * Homework will consist of readings, forum posts and occasional other stuff.
* Materials you'll need will be on this github repo, but you'll typically turn stuff in on ELMS.

*Forum Posts | Due by Sunday at 11:59 p.m.*

* Forum Post 1: We will spend much of the semester working with a newly-released database of opioid shipments, made available by the Washington Post. The Washington Post has been breaking stories of national importance holding the government, drug companies, pharmacies and others to account for their role in the deadly opioid epidemic that killed nearly 100,000 people in the U.S. between 2006 and 2012. Carefully read the story "76 billion opioid pills: Newly released federal data unmasks the epidemic." In a forum post of 300 words or less, do the following:
  * Based on the information in the story, briefly explain the nature of the database analyzed by the Post.  What is it called? What information does it include?
  * Identify two sentences in the story -- facts -- that you think were the most important products of original data analysis by the Post.  
  * Google the people named in the story bylines and contribution line at the bottom of the story? What are the names and job titles of people you think worked on the analysis in the story?    
* Forum Post 2: Skim through "The Data Stories Brainstorming" guide and "Data Stories: Census examples" from NYT Training include common types of "data stories" -- i.e. (contrasting two things, drilling down, outliers).  On your own, go out and find a news story that includes a bit of data analysis that fits into one of these "data story" frames.  In less than 100 words, provide a link and explain how the story fits into that frame.
* Forum Post 3: The boundaries of what qualifies as "data journalism" are not easily defined. Read "Why Journalists Should Use Data" and "Why Data Journalism is Important".  In 200 words or less, explain what you think data journalism is, why you are interested in learning it, and how you hope to incorporate it in the journalism work you do going forward.
* Forum Post 4: We'll talk a lot about the process of data journalism in this course, the work data journalists do that ends with the release of a story founded on original data analysis.  Read "What the Fox Knows", "The Inverted Pyramid of Data Journalism" and "About the Markup."  Each of these offers some insight into the process of doing data journalism work, from the very detailed -- Nate Silver's breakdown -- to the less detailed -- Paul Bradshaw's take -- to the very short: "Our journalism is guided by the scientific method; we develop hypotheses and collect data to test those hypotheses," from the Markup. In 200 words or less, do your best at describing the process by which data journalists go from nothing to story.
