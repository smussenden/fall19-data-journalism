* This week's lab will be posted later today.

#### Post Opioid Story.

Pull up post story on screen.

Lots of you identified this fact:
* "Just six companies distributed 75 percent of the pills during this period: McKesson Corp., Walgreens, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen, CVS and Walmart, according to an analysis of the database by The Washington Post. Three companies manufactured 88 percent of the opioids: SpecGx, a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt; Actavis Pharma; and Par Pharmaceutical, a subsidiary of Endo Pharmaceuticals."

Lots of you identified this fact:
* “the states that received the highest concentrations of pills per person per year were: West Virginia with 66.5, Kentucky with 63.3, South Carolina with 58, Tennessee with 57.7 and Nevada with 54.7."

Who did it?

--Ask MAYA to read hers
Of the people who contributed to this story, I think Steven Rich, database editor for investigations; Aaron Williams, investigative data reporter; Andrew Ba Tran, data reporter; and Christopher Rowland, business reporter played a big part in analyzing the data for this story. But I do think that all of the reporters involved had a hand in it.

-- LAUREN ANIKIS to read hers
While I'm sure all three contributors worked on the analysis, I believe Steven Rich and Scott Higham did the most work with the raw numbers.  Steven Rich is a database editor, so he would work directly with the databases and analyzing the numbers.  This would probably include organizing the databases so that the journalists can understand what the numbers mean and where the main stories would be.  Higham is an investigative reporter, so he probably works to understand what the numbers mean and dive deeper into the story that the numbers make up.  Sari Horwitz is the third contributor, she is a reporter who cover the Justice Department and criminal justice.  She probably worked with the numbers after they had been analyzed, with her understanding of the Justice Department and criminal justice issues she would be able to put the numbers into proper context.

#### Review Data Acquisition project
--Assign

#### Review lab for today


#### Lab guidelines

Have open spreadsheet for Logan County WV we did for in class exercise.  

Show how they were broken down into totals.  Not the raw data.  

These were generated from the raw data. And if you really want to do this work, you need to start working with raw data.

That's what we're going to do today, and we're going to use an incredibly powerful tool. Pivot tables.
