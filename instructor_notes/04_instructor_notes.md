#### Questions ABOUT Lab
* Questions about the lab you did two weeks ago? Anything people didn't understand? I'll be walking around and you can ask.  
* This week's lab will be posted later today.

#### Data acquisition

**Talk to one-on-one**

* Christine: switch assignments.

**Overall notes**

* It's worth your while to read what your colleagues are posting.  A lot of these programs seem to be funded in similar ways, called similar things in different cities, run by similar agencies. Often called "Homeward Bound" program.  Portland: "Reunification/Transportation Services". Santa Monica: Project Homecoming.
* A lot of you put out phone calls and sent emails, but haven't heard back.  
  * Maya: you actually got someone on the phone, and found out that they have a dataset back to 2002.  How did you get Lisa Kemp on the phone? Will they just give you the data?
  * Ryan: you actually got someone on the phone, Anne Scott, head of the regional homelessness.  Many of you set out trying to identify the data person and going through that route, but Ryan went to the top.  Why?
  * Meghan: you actually got someone on the phone, Christine Messenger from Humboldt social services. IMPORTANT: she said there was "aggregate data" and wants to know dates.  What did you tell her. THIS IS CRITICAL. We do not want aggregate data.  We want raw data.  We want to do our own analysis?
  * Sara: you found that their "Homeward Bound" program is run by the salvation army but funded by the city. Could this be a problem down the road for us?
  * Luciana: called the police, human resources, a regional center.  Identified Alisa Orduna called her but she didn't call back.  Also did something smart, which was to call Constance Ferrel, who is a flack for the organization. It's fine to call PR people if you're not getting calls back from direct sources.   
  * Josh: let's talk through yours.  What makes you think Antoinette Pietka is the person?  What can we do next?
  * Bryan: let's talk through yours, Santa Cruz homeward bound program.  What can you do next?
  * Emily: you found sort of a false lead, on rapid rehousing. What's your next move?

**Excuses**

* JILIAN - "He told me that if  I wanted to request statistics or any data more detailed than what's already provided on the public police logs, I would need to file a FOIA. He seemed eager to deter me from that; when the conversation reached that point, he began warning me about how expensive and time-consuming it would be to request the data."


#### POST OPIOID SUIT

* Not every data request will take that kind of protracted legal battle to get. But I want to reinforce that the good stuff takes WORK to get.  

#### 38 excuses

**I love the strength and confidence I'm seeing in these.  These records are open, give them to me dammit.  Firm but polite in potential responses, which is how I want you to be.**

* Our programmer is too busy with official business.
* “If we give it to you, we’ll have to give it to everyone,”
* Dimas: We’ll be happy to give it to you, for $1.2 million. (Get an itemized estimate; ask for media exemption;. Meghan you actually did this, describe project.
* JOSH “That information is not public record” and my favourite response is simply “Show me the statute that says the compilation isn’t a public record”. The law is our friend.
* LAUREN: "We don’t think you’ll understand the data / technology, you’ll mess it up. Especially looking for raw data as a female journalist, I do expect to get responses like this a lot."  We all get this.  But it's a known thing that we talk about at data journalism conferences, women more often get this response. THIS HAPPENED TO COLLEEN CURRAN LAST SEMESTER: for emissions data from state cars.  We just kept reassuing them that we would rely on their expertiese to make sure we weren't misinterpriting, and run our analysis by experts.
* Dana: There are confidential records mixed in. WHAT WAS YOUR RESPONSE?  Most public records laws have "severability" clasuses.  As in, don't deny the whole record, just because part is confidential.  We may see this with names or SSN or other info on homelessness.
* RYAN: My favorite excuse is, "There’s nothing in the state record laws that says anything about electronic records, therefore…" To which, I would say, "Exactly. There is nothing in there allowing you to not give me the files digitally." I feel like this was the biggest hurdle I dealt with in Florida. Everyone wanted to give it to me in paper, 10 cents a page, or on a disc, $10 dollars per. Convincing PIOs to send them via email, or even put them on my own disc or jump drive, was difficult enough trying to get documents.
* LEAH: I like this sample excuse and response: The person that knows how to do that is on vacation for two weeks / doesn’t work here anymore. Response: Who is the back-up? I’ll talk to them.  This method would be effective because, if they don't assist you, you can respond with something like: "Oh, well, will anyone be around to help with my story? If I don't get a response, I'll have to say that you all couldn't be reached and/or declined to comment, and I wouldn't want to have to do that. I really value your organization's perspective and assistance." POLITE BUT FIRM
* JILLIAN: In response to someone claiming "we don't keep our data that way":    How DO you keep your data (get record layout). That’s OK, just give us what you’ve got. ALWAYS GET THE RECORD LAYOUT
