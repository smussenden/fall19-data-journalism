This is a spreadsheet
  --Data is organized into rows and columns, a grid.
  --Data is inside of a "cell".  
  --This is tidy, structured data.  
  --When you're just starting out, common to work with very clean, well structured data. Most of the time, it's not like this.  
  --At a basic level, all contained in a single table.  This is a spreadsheet.
  --When you have multiple tables in one, that's a "workbook", and, if the tables are related, organized into something called a database, which we'll get to later in this course.
  --Data journalists often work with "unstructured data" too, like big repositories of text documents.  But most of the data we'll work with in this class will be tidy and structured like this.   

First Steps
  --Make a copy, preserve original.
  --Put in source, with link, so you know where you got it.
  --Four Corners Check
    --Check that data is preserved
    --Are there missing values?
    --Weird characters?  
    --Dates that look strange?
    --Are there "calculated columns"?
  --Add record numbers: Good Time to talk about cursors and copying and selecting.   
  --Freeze panes
  --Make sure you know what you're looking at! What do these columns mean?  Is there documentation?
