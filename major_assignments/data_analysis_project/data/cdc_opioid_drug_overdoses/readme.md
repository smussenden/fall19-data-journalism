# About this data

This folder contains a tab delimited text file.

The file contains information about fatal drug overdoses in each county that involved opioids, cumulative from 2006-2012.  Data is not really available for each year.  

It was downloaded from the CDC Wonder Multiple Cause of Death Data Explorer. https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10.html

Want more data or want it sliced a different way?  Feel free to download it. The data is not available by ZIP Code, but you can get it by state or other Census divisions.

The standard used to subset fatal drug overdoses followed the one set by the CDC on this page:
https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/prescribing/overdose-death-maps.html

Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44, X60–X64, X85, and Y10–Y14.

The following ICD codes are used to capture opioids.
opioids (T40.0, T40.1, T40.2, T40.3, T40.4, or T40.6); natural and semisynthetic opioids (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioids, other than methadone (T40.4); and heroin (T40.1).

The information included is:

* County name
* County FIPS code
* Total opioid overdose deaths between 2006 and 2012.
* County population in 2000.  
* Crude opioid overdose death rate (# of deaths per 100K population). This is an estimate.  The rate is given, but also the two numbers that form the lower and upper bounds of 95 percent confidence interval, and the standard error.
* Age adjusted overdose death rate (# of deaths per 100K population). This is an estimate.  The rate is given, but also the two numbers that form the lower and upper bounds of 95 percent confidence interval, and the standard error.
* Percent of total deaths between 2006 and 2012 that were opioid overdose deaths.

Note:
* The rate in some small counties may not be reported for privacy reasons or because the estimate was deemed unreliable by the CDC.
