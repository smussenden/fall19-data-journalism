# Data Acquisition Project

This project will give you some real-world experience in trying to get a useful dataset from a government agency – or trying to pry it out of the hands of its keepers, which may turn out to be a more appropriate description of the effort in some cases.   

## Grading

This project is worth 20 percent of your grade, broken up into assignments throughout the semester.  Your grade does not depend on whether you successfully get the database. Your grade does depend on whether you display a solid, steady, intelligent effort that takes advantage of your journalistic skills, your familiarity with the issues in data acquisition, your knowledge of the law and the approaches we discuss in class.

## Seeking data

There are two equally valid approaches to the project.  You can seek your own dataset.  Or you can help get data for a Howard Center for Investigative Journalism project on homelessness and housing.

#### Your own idea

If you have an idea for a database you would like to acquire for this project please talk with me. The dataset must be stored in electronic form, but not be available online in its complete form.  It must be a data set from a U.S. state or local government agency. It cannot be a federal dataset (they take too long to get, for the purpose of this class). If you're unsure about whether a dataset exists, talk to me and we'll brainstorm some approaches.

#### Homeless bussing data

Everyone else will be seeking a database from a county or city with information about "homeless relocation" programs in U.S. cities. The programs were detailed in this excellent 2017 Guardian story [Bussed out:
How America moves its homeless](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study).  

We will be seeking updated data from the following cities that the Guardian identified as having homeless bussing programs.

If you're not in the in the CNS/Howard investigative bureau with Deb Nelson, we'll assign you today to bucket one.

## Essential Elements and Deadlines

This is a reporting project. You will need to do web research to identify the correct agencies to contact, and the people in those agencies to contact.  But it will take a lot more than web research.  You will need to call people and email them to identify who keeps the data, what it's called, what's in it, and attempt to coax it out of them -- either with a public records request or without one.

Here are the milestones you'll need to follow:

* Week 3 - Project introduced.  Forum post with update on reporting due by Sunday.
* Week 4 - Forum post with update on reporting due by Sunday and link to Google spreadsheet contact log.
* Week 6 - Forum post with update on reporting due by Sunday and link to Google spreadsheet contact log.
* Week 7 - Draft of public records request due by Sunday and link to Google spreadsheet contact log.  
* Week 8 - Send public records request by Sunday.
* Week 11 - Forum post with update on post-request reporting due by Sunday and link to Google spreadsheet contact log.
* Week 13 - Slide deck for project presentation due by Sunday and link to Google spreadsheet contact log.
* Week 14 - Project presentations.


## Contact log

You will maintain a written log of your contacts as a Google spreadsheet.  This is an essential and vitally important part of this project. This log, which you will submit as part of your graded work on this assignment along with your final report, should include the following for each occasion that you reach or even attempt to reach someone for this project:  

* the person’s full name;
* his or her job title;
* the agency for which he or she works;
* the location of that agency;
* at least enough contact information so that you can find this person again later or so that someone else reading the log could find this person again (phone number, e-mail address or both);
* the date and time;
* and a brief summary of what transpired.  

Some of the people you deal with – say, the receptionists or assistants who first answer the phone – may not want to give you their names, but you can always try telling them that you like to keep a record of the people with whom you speak. Your thoroughness may be appreciated.  An inadequate log – especially one that does not provide enough information for someone reading the log to know precisely whom you contacted, how you contacted them, when you contacted them and what you discussed – may prevent you from getting a passing grade for this assignment.

## How to Identify Yourself

If you're seeking homeless data, you should identify yourself as a data reporter for the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, a non-profit investigative reporting unit in Maryland.  If someone asks if you're a student, tell the truth, but don't volunteer it.  The people with whom you are dealing with need to understand that this database could be used as the foundation for a news story.

If you are seeking your own data, talk to me, and we'll discuss how to identify yourself.  It's best to have a news organization you're seeking the data for (i.e. The Diamondback or an internship organization).

## Request Letter

Do not send a request letter without getting it approved by me in advance.  When it's ready, I'll give you Howard Center letterhead to put it on for sending.

In most cases, you'll need to draft a public information act request letter to get the data, based on the laws of that state.  In order to draft a good request letter with a high chance of getting filled, you'll need to do a lot of reporting to learn if the data you seek exists, who keeps the data (the custodian), what it's called and what's in it, what might be exempt from disclosure and other information.  

You'll also need to familiarize with the law in the state and write a letter based on public records laws in the state.

When you do request the database, you will ask for a waiver of fees in any written request for the database. You will need to negotiate over this issue if the agency proposes to charge you for the data, and we will talk in class about how to do that. You are not required or expected to pay for this database yourself.

## Presentation and Slide Deck

You will make a verbal presentation to the class (5 minutes) on your project. During the presentations, we will discuss your experiences and what steps might help to pry the data from reluctant gatekeepers.  You should include the following elements, with exactly one slide for each one.

* About the database:  Describe the database you sought and whom you sought it from.
* About the law: How did you determine that these are public records?
* About the negotiation: Tell us about your contacts with the agency. Did officials put up barriers to access or accommodate you? Did they object to releasing the data in electronic form? What was the outcome?
* Looking ahead: If you have not obtained the data, what steps would you or someone else need to take to perfect the request?
* Lessons learned: What did you learn from this project that you might be able to apply to future reporting efforts and that would be useful for other students to know?  Did you learn anything about yourself? Your insights here are an important feature of the assignment.
