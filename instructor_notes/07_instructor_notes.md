# Session 07 Instructor Notes

### Review of Joins
--walk through, inner, outer, left and right joins

### Opioid and Death Rates
--More straightforward. Joined opioid deaths, with opioids per person.  Found a high degree of correlation.  Didn't report the correlation coefficient (r) determination coefficient (r2), more descriptive. Highly suggested the two were linked

### Speeding Cops
--What did they find?
--How did they do it?
--Sunpass Toll records for cops.
--By joining location of toll booth with time went through toll booth, could calculate speed!   

### Data Acquisition Project
--I'll be coming around to talk to you about it.
--Your letters are due as a forum post, using the SPLC generator.  
--DO NOT SEND LETTER yet
--Guidelines: be specific, for now say willing to pay 0, reference phone conversations.

### Data Analysis Project
--Will describe in more detail next week.
--It's what we've been building to all semester.
--30 percent of your grade.
--You're going to work with opioid data in more raw form and find a story that we can report out.   
--To that end, we're going to read this week how three local news orgs localized this opioid data, taking very different approaches: one focused on an especially significant neighborhood; one did an enterprise join to focus on racial discrepancies in usage rates; another did an enterprise join with campaign contribution data to look at the politicians propping up the biggest manufacturers.  
--Readings and three forum posts.

### Labs and In Class Assignments
--Heard from some of you that in class assignment took TRULY insane amounts of time, like 3 hours, for which...I apologize. Not my intention to have them take that long.  
--I've reduced the number of questions on this week's lab to 5, with free form additional questions if you finish in time. And I've tried to build in some more hints that might help.
--If you're struggling or not getting something, make an appointment and come talk to me.  I think everyone should be able to get this stuff, so let me help you.
--Today's lab.
