# Session 10 Instructor Notes


# Overall, how's it going.

* This is how it works in the real world.  It's messy, shit doesn't work, you have to debug, data isn't clean, tables won't join, you're missing data that you need. It's hard to figure out where to go next.  

* BUT...it gets easier with time and repetition.  The same problems happen over and over.  I'm here to tell you, it gets better.

* One note: generally what I'm looking for is a question writeup followed by code followed by an answer. Need to be sharper about what you're finding.  What is interesting?  Not just doing the query, but what are you discovering?

* Some of you are much further along than others.  A reminder that in to weeks, you have another dump due, and I'm expecting to see an extremely sophisticated amount of progress there.  

* If you're running into problems, we'll work on stuff today.  And you should make time before you leave class to come see me.  

# What next.  Some questions to ask yourself.
* What problems are standing in your way, and what's your plan to solve them? A lot of tech problems I'm seeing out there using ARCOS API or Census API.  
* Are you having trouble figuring out what questions to ask?  The best questions come from having a deep understanding of the topic you're interested in.  Have you read enough about the topic?  Who can you talk to or interview (as a Howard Center data journalist, not a student) who can help you figure out what to look for?  
* Is your original idea not panning out?  Have you noticed something maybe more interesting than your original idea? How can you pivot? This is common, btw, to go in with one idea, and come out with a different story.   
* Is there data you need you haven't gotten yet?  How can you get it?
* Are there single locations evident of trend you've identified? Remember that ultimately you're going to be pitching me on a STORY, and to tell that story you're going to propose how you'd report it out.  Start thinking about that now.  Where in the U.S. are the human characters who could bring this story to life?   


# Today
* Open lab.
* I'm giving everyone until Sunday to update this before I mark it for grading.  I'll come around and tell you you're fine, or I'd expect to see more work from you at this point.  
* If you want to continue working on it through Sunday, I'll give you extra credit if I tell you you're fine.
* Submit a response to original forum post saying you updated.

# Can get EC
Emily Top - unbelievably strong.  Good plan for where to go next.  Can get extra credit for continuing to work.

Meghan - a ton of work to do. Having a joining problem.

Christine - Great job.  Can get extra credit for doing more.  Still need to work on the central question, which she can now that has data.

Ryan - good, can get extra credit

Bryan - good, can get extra credit for using COC data.

Jazmin - really nice work. Would like to see answers written in.  I'm running scripts to get you the nationwide stuff today.  Can get extra credit for doing more work.

# Minor work

Maya - Some good effort here. Remember thing we discussed: take national averages using county level data for median income and other markers. And then, in Anne Arundel County, do census tracts to do the same analysis.  A little work to do to sharpen.

Dimas - Good, needs to sharpen queries around central question.  Can we get deaths by year or overall deaths and shape query around that. A little work to do to sharpen.  

Jillian - pretty good. Having some join issues with HIV data.


# Need to view haven't seen yet

Joshua Martin - need to see his.

Dana - need to look

# Some Work to do

Arya - OK.  Still think we're missing the national piece, and didn't see much related to the question that makes this bigger than just "lets desribe pills in moco" story, the examination based on income.

Luciana - A lot of work still to do. Plan seems good.

Lauren - need to sharpen rural vs urban. Use USDA urban rural continum. Need to ask in a more concentrated way. More work to do.

Sarah - struggling to bring in population data.  Lots more to do.


# Lots work to do
Leah - still more work to do.
Matt Brown - Just pulled in census data.  Didn't pull in death data or shipment data.  Need to see whether shipment aligns.  Some scatterplots with smooth line could help see that.  A LOT of work to do.
Mia - OK, plan seems pretty clear, but need to actually do the work. A lot of work to do.
Miller - Still has to do pretty much all the work.  And need to remind him that he really needs to expand it out and look at NATIONAL trend, and then show Maryland how it plays out here.
